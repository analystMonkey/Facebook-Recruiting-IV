Bot Detection in Online Auctions 
========================================================

This article will present a way to detect bots in online auctions. This is how [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot) presented the problem: *"Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting."*  

Here the problem at hand is binary classification with two interesting properties.
*The data contains approximately 4% users identified as robots, which makes an unbalanced classification problem.
*the data corresponding to each bidder, if used completely, becomes bigger than the data points(number of observations). In other words, this can potentially become a p>>n where p is the number of variables and n is the number of observations.  

Next, I will present a way to identify robots with a score of approximately 0.927 AUC with the data available plus additional considerations for improving the score according to other participants on Kaggle.  

The model here described needs approximately 6-7GB of memory during the data mining only because it is done in parallel for increased performance. But if you choose to run it sequentially the memory fingerprint won't surpass 2GB. The main algorithm training won't require much memory either.  

The data can be downloaded on:
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/data)  

Note: This markdown guide does not execute the code but it simply comments different parts of the code and includes images whenever necessary. The reason for this is that even though the code is not computationally intensive, the creation of a HTML and execution of the code in knitr is. For the full code implementation and other functions here not present please refer to the repository [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV)  

###Init & Libraries

First consider making a "SETTINGS.json" with your own file paths. Moreover, many of this libraries (*leaps*, *ggplot2*) aren't necessary for the prediction but they are being used for visualization and parameter importance calculations.  

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
require("rjson")
require("parallel")
require("data.table")
require("bit64")
require("leaps")
require("tm")
require("xgboost")
require("SparseM")
require("prospectr")
require("Metrics")
require("ggplot2")

#Read Settings file
directories <- fromJSON(file = "SETTINGS.json")

#Set Directories
workingDirectory <- directories$workingDirectory
setwd(workingDirectory)
#Set Data Directory
dataDirectory <- directories$dataDirectory
#EDA Plots location
EDAPlotsLoc <- directories$EDALoc

#Define extra functions
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "bidderId2Boilerplate.R"))
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "timeNumericFeatures.R"))
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "featureLengths.R"))
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "dispersionTimeFeatures.R"))
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "simultaneousAuctionTimeFinder.R"))
source(file.path(workingDirectory, "multiplot.R"))

#Detect available cores
numCores <- detectCores()
```

###Load Data  
Now we load the data into R; I have found that using the option "verbose" when loading the data into memory is often a good idea since it shows the amount of memory used and other interesting statistics such as number of NAs.  

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
train <- fread(file.path(dataDirectory, directories$trainFile), verbose = TRUE)
test <- fread(file.path(dataDirectory, directories$testFile), verbose = TRUE)
bids <- fread(file.path(dataDirectory, directories$bids), verbose = TRUE)
```
  
###Data Transformations
Some transformations are required but not completely needed, this is done in order to guarantee randomness and increase slightly performance. Feel free to edit this part.  


```{r results='hide', message=FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
#Remove training data that cannot be found in the bids data table
train <- train[train$bidder_id %in% bids$bidder_id]
#Shuffle Training Dataset
set.seed(1011011)
train <- train[sample(1:nrow(train), nrow(train))]
#Remove testing data that cannot be found in the bids data table
validTestDocuments <- which(test$bidder_id %in% bids$bidder_id)
test <- test[test$bidder_id %in% bids$bidder_id]

#Sort bids by time
bids <- bids[order(rank(-time))]

#No Country change to "NoCountry" string
bids$country[bids$country == ""] <- "nocountry"
#Add more letters to countries to avoid deletion by the tm package
bids$country <- paste0("country", bids$country)

#Auction Time Medians + Median Average Deviations
auctionsScoresTable <- mclapply(unique(bids$auction), timeNumericFeatures, mc.cores = numCores,
                                bidsDt = bids)

auctionsScoresTable <- do.call(rbind, auctionsScoresTable)

#Merge standard scores with bids data
bids <- merge(bids, auctionsScoresTable, by = "bid_id")
#Orphan auctions / bids transform secuential value to FALSE
bids$sequential[is.na(bids$sequential)] <- FALSE
rm(auctionsScoresTable)
```

###Feature Engineering
The Bulk of computer time is spend here. Feature engineering in this problem is what defines how precise the model really is. Here I propose 3 different types of numeric features types within which there are further features mainly being statistical-dispersion features of bidders. The additional features extracted from the dataset are:  

####Dispersion Features  
  +Time Range Of Activity across all auctions  
  +Time Range Of Activity, first derivative  
  +Resting Time across all auctions, time without bids since the beginning of the auction  
  +Resting Time, first derivative  
  +Time between the final bid and end of auction  
  +Time between the final bid and end of auction, first derivative   
  +Linear Fit of previous features  

The code can be found on: [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/dispersionTimeFeatures.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/dispersionTimeFeatures.R) and lines 81-126 on [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R)  

####Feature Lengths
 +Statistical Features of Bidder's Auctions  
 +Statistical Features of Bidder's Device  
 +Statistical Features of Bidder's Country  
 +Statistical Features of Bidder's Ips  
 +Statistical Features of Bidder's Urls  
The code can be found on: [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/featureLengths.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/featureLengths.R) and lines 128-141 on [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R) 

####Simultaneous Actions
 +Frequencies in Bids
 +Simultaneous Auctions
 +Simultaneous Devices
 +Simultaneous Countries
The code can be found on: [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/simultaneousAuctionTimeFinder.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/simultaneousAuctionTimeFinder.R) and lines 143-166 on [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R) 

At the beginning the code looked for simultaneous, that is, actions with matching times. However, after correlations search and cross validations it was found that if we searched actions within a certain window of time, the function would yield better results. More information about the parameter search for this function can be found on [https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R) lines 233-288  

####All Bidder's data
There are two possibilities. One is to leave the numerical features and try to extract more features like it was suggested on the forum [https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/forums/t/14628/share-your-secret-sauce](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/forums/t/14628/share-your-secret-sauce)
and the other is the one that I used that is extracting every single unique value from the bids data.
[https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R](https://github.com/wacax/Facebook-Recruiting-IV/blob/master/FacebookRaw.R) lines 168-178
If you choose this way the result will be a matrix where p>>n that is where the features are more than the data points.

##EDA
We now can look for the best features in this set.
![Linear Feature Selection](/home/wacax/Wacax/Kaggle/FacebookIV/EDA/LinearFeatureImportance.png)

Unsurprisingly, almost all data is useful. So as a recommendation it is better to keep all the numeric data in case you are training with a tree based algorithm.

##Cross Validation and Modeling
Given that this dataset only contains 1984 rows of valid data, cross validation is of vital importance. I explored two different approaches, linear modeling with elastic-net regularization with the *glmnet* package and boosted trees with the *xgboost* library. In this case *xgboost* was clearly superior.  

The cross validation was performed with the following code:
```{r results='hide', message=FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
#Cross validation
numberOfRepeatedModels <- 10
xgboostAUC <- sapply(seq(1, numberOfRepeatedModels), function(modelNumber, train){
  
  xgboostModelCV <- xgb.cv(data = train, nrounds = 70, nfold = 5, showsd = TRUE, 
                           metrics = "auc", verbose = TRUE, "eval_metric" = "auc",
                           "objective" = "binary:logistic", "max.depth" = 80, 
                           "nthread" = numCores, "set.seed" = 101010 + modelNumber)
  
  #Plot the progress of the model
  holdoutAucScores <- as.data.frame(xgboostModelCV)
  holdoutAucScores$test.auc.mean <- as.numeric(holdoutAucScores$test.auc.mean)
  holdoutAucScores$iteration <- seq(1, nrow(holdoutAucScores))
  print(ggplot(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = test.auc.mean)) + geom_line())
  
  #Save AUC and the location of the best iteration
  auc <- max(movav(holdoutAucScores$test.auc.mean, w = 5))
  bestIter <- which.max(movav(holdoutAucScores$test.auc.mean, w = 5)) + 2
  
  print(paste0("model number ", modelNumber, " has an AUC of: ", auc))
  return(c(auc, bestIter, as.numeric(holdoutAucScores$test.auc.mean)))
  
}, train = DMMatrixTrain)

print(paste0("average AUC of ",  mean(xgboostAUC[1, ]), " with ", numberOfRepeatedModels, " models."))
bestIteration <- floor(mean(xgboostAUC[2, ]))

#xgboost cross validation plot with n models
holdoutAucScores <- as.data.frame(xgboostAUC[3:nrow(xgboostAUC), ])
holdoutAucScores$iteration <- seq(1, nrow(holdoutAucScores))
ggplot() + geom_line(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = V1), colour = 'red') +
  geom_line(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = V2), colour = 'blue') + 
  geom_line(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = V3), colour = 'magenta') +
  geom_line(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = V4), colour = 'green') +
  geom_line(data = holdoutAucScores, aes(x = iteration, y = V5), colour = 'black')

```

![Repeated Cross Validation](/home/wacax/Wacax/Kaggle/FacebookIV/FinalModelData/Repeated10FoldCVPerformance.png)

As you might have probably guessed this is a repeated cross-validation. This is done to ensure the accuracy of the AUC value and to avoid overfitting. This idea is thanks to Manuel Amunategui. For more information about repeated cross validation check out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7CGAfSr_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7CGAfSr_Y)  

Now we have an idea about the approximate accuracy of our model so now we start building the real model with all the data and with variable importance calculation to see what variables are the most important. For that we will choose the 50 most important variables to display.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
#Full Model with slow learning (eta = 0.003)
xgboostModelSlow <- xgboost(data = DMMatrixTrain, nrounds = 6000,
                            showsd = TRUE, metrics = "auc", verbose = TRUE, "eta" = 0.001,
                            "objective" = "binary:logistic", "max.depth" = 80, "eval_metric" = "auc",
                            "colsample_bytree" = 0.95,
                            "set.seed" = 10001001)

model <- xgb.dump(xgboostModelSlow, with.stats = T)

#Plot feature importance  
# Compute feature importance matrix
importanceMatrix <- xgb.importance(c(engineeredFeaturesNames, corpusTerms), model = xgboostModelSlow)  
#Importance graph
print(xgb.plot.importance(importanceMatrix[1:50,]))
#Save Plot
dev.print(file = file.path(EDAPlotsLoc , "VariableImportanceSlowModel"),
          device = png, width = 1200)

#Predict
xgboostPredictionSlow <- predict(xgboostModelSlow, DMMatrixTest)
```
![Variable Importance](/home/wacax/Wacax/Kaggle/FacebookIV/FinalModelData/VariableImportanceSlowModel0001.png)

Our model is now ready and the variable importance are ready too. What is interesting here is that there are certain auctions, devices, Urls and IPs that are related to bots directly or at least are suspicious. So even after modeling you can also check what raw variables are related to suspicious activity and suspicious behavior thanks to our statistical/numerical data. 


##Room for improvement
There are three basic ways were you can improve this model. The most obvious is choosing a lower column sample value to simulate the behavior of random forests. This is recommended because according to the participants of this challenge random forests was the most accurate model. Use repeated cross validation to select the best parameter.
Second, as it was pointed out in this document before, create your own features, here are some ideas
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/forums/t/14628/share-your-secret-sauce](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/forums/t/14628/share-your-secret-sauce).
And third, ensemble, there were reports of combined algorithms giving a better AUC score, for example selecting a linear model plus a tree based model, or alternatively using meta-learners to select the best scores of other algorithms. Though this must be used with caution given the size of the data.
